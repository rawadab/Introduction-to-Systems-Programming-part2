Coupon Management System

Academic Systems Programming Project (Java, Spring Boot)

Designed and implemented a full Coupon Management System developed in two phases, progressing from low-level systems programming to modern backend architecture.


Phase 2 – Modern Backend Architecture

Refactored the system using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate.

Migrated DAOs to JPA Entities and Repositories

Converted Facades into Spring Services

Implemented system components (LoginManager, Daily Job, Test runner) as Singletons

Integrated automated system execution on application startup

This project demonstrates strong understanding of systems programming, backend development, design patterns, multithreading, and scalable Java architecture.
